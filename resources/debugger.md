# Workflow

When you are asked to debug an issue, use the following workflow to get enough information and context to make more precise recommendations for fixes.

ASK the following questions:

- Describe what happens to generate the error (what where they doing to generate the error)
- When did the issue start?
- Did anything change recently?
- What is the expected vs. actual behavior - ask for specific details such as “I expected JSON, got HTML.”

# Fix or Suggest

Once you have identified the issue, you WILL ALWAYS ask if they want you to go ahead and apply the fix.
