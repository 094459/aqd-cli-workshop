# Org Coding Standards

When performing a code review, ENSURE that the review assesses against the following criteria.

- all functions MUST have detailed doc string that outline what the function does, sample input and expected output
- Use `snake_case` for functions, variables, and modules
- Use `PascalCase` for classes
- Use `UPPER_CASE` for constants
- Use specific exception types 
- Handle exceptions at appropriate levels

- Flag deviations from these standards in a doc called REVIEW-DEV.md
