## Understanding Codebases

**Overview**

In this lab we are going to build upon the project we have been building, adding some documentation to help folk who come after us to understand what this codebase does/.

- current project we have built, lets use explain to understand how it works
- draw some diagrams


Lets do something a little different this time

- check out amazon q cli project
- ask some questions : can you review the code and tell me how to configure mcp.settings, or can you explain what qterm does

---


**Summary and clean up**

In this lab we used Amazon Q CLI to help us understand code, whether that was ad hoc questions we have about how it works, or how to use it to document our projects. This is the last lab and so you should look to clean up resources created. You should:

* delete the project directory we created ("aqcli-app")
* review and remove as needed any Amazon Q CLI configuration files (mcp.json for example)

You can [proceed back to the README](/README.md) and grab some follow up resources, or if you have an AWS Account, why not try the next lab, [07-Working with AWS](/workshop/07-working-with-aws.md).
