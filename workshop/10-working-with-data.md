# Working with data

In all the previous labs you have seen how you can use Kiro CLI to write, test, and debug code. You have also explored how you can use to to automate your developer tasks, and how it excels at writing scripts. In this section we are going to explore another area where Kiro CLI will help you - working with data. We have already explored some of the ways - in earlier workshops you used data models as steering artifacts, and generated entity relationship diagrams from those data models. This lab just touches upon some of the use cases.

## Overview

In these labs you are going to explore some of the use cases and techniques that will help you apply Kiro when you are working with all things data. We will explore:

* simplifying how you work across different data formats
* generating sample data, with the help of a custom agent
* writing SQL queries
* how to leverage Model Context Protocol to interact with your data

These labs just touch the potential use cases where you can apply Kiro.
