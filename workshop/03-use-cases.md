## Exploring Use Cases

There are no labs in this section of this tutorial. We are just going to explore and look at some of the ways that you can use some of the features and capabilities within Amazon Q CLI.

If you have suggestions that we should add, please raise an issue/PR and we will review and update. I would love to see how folks are using Amazon Q CLI.

### Use Cases for Amazon Q CLI

So what use cases are best suited for using tools like Amazon Q Developer CLI. I have seen people using it for very broad and wide use cases, these are just a few examples.

* Automation - whether its writing bash scripts, or helping you to run your favorite cli commands, using Amazon Q CLI on the command line is a huge productivity boost. (check out [Making Makefiles for fun and profit](https://dev.to/aws/making-makefiles-for-fun-and-profit-kl6))
* Interacting with your AWS account - anything you can do using the aws cli, you can now get done with the help of Amazon Q CLI. Whether that is getting billing information about your AWS accounts, generating reports about your environments, or deploying workloads, Amazon Q CLI is a great helper.
* Writing code - whilst the other use cases have been more traditionally done in the command line, you can also use Amazon Q CLI to build full applications from the command line. (check out [Writing code with Amazon Q CLI and Zed](https://dev.to/aws/building-a-book-sharing-application-with-amazon-q-cli-5dl8))
* Vibe Coding - if you want to vibe code, then Amazon Q CLI can vibe with the best of them. From your prompts, let Amazon Q CLI build your projects and then run them, all in record time.
* Building games - a great way to learn coding is to write simple (or even more complex) games, and you can do that using Amazon Q CLI. (check out [How a 12 year old built a game with Amazon Q Developer CLI.](https://dev.to/aws/game-building-fun-with-a-12-year-old-and-the-amazon-q-developer-cli-2khg))
* Refactoring Code - have a code base that you want to refactor? Maybe want to go from PHP to Python? Then you can use Amazon Q CLI to refactor either parts of whole projects (check out [From PHP to Python - porting a Reddit clone with the help of Amazon Q Developer](https://dev.to/aws/from-php-to-python-porting-a-reddit-clone-with-the-help-of-amazon-q-developer-23g))
* Debugging issues - one of the strongest use cases that I use Amazon Q CLI for on a daily basis, is to help me troubleshoot and debug issues. From finding out how to fix different error messages, to reviewing logs, I am amazed how Amazon Q CLI lets me speed up this process.
* Documenting - writing project documentation, including creating diagrams, is something Amazon Q CLI can help you with. However, its not just limited to this. If you have a code base that has no documentation, you can use Amazon Q CLI to explain what the project does. When I was writing MCP blog posts, I needed to find out how logging and the configuration file worked. I asked Amazon Q CLI to explore the code base and answer these questions. After reviewing the output with the team working on the project, it got it spot on.

So these are just a few of the uses cases. Let me know if you are using it for something else.

### Supporting Resources

**Managing your prompts**

We have seen that managing files that you use as context is as important as the prompts you use.

I have found managing these in markdown documents work well, and I managed these via a local repository that I used to store them based on the project I was working on. However, there is a better way, and I am beginning to use an amazing tool created by an AWS Community Builder, Christian Bonzelete, called [Promptz](https://www.promptz.dev/). 

You can login and save your own prompts, as well as see what prompts others have created and try these out. Even better, you can connect to the MCP Server for tools and prompts. We use this in the Getting Start lab for MCP Servers.

Check this incredible resource out - learn from the community, and be sure to share back too.

### Completed!

Congratulations, you have a good foundation in how to use Amazon Q CLI. We are now ready to proceed with the first part of building our application in [Part One](building-our-app-part-1.md)
